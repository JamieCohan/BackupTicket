        <p>
           We are TC EVENTS. We are a small company dedicated to providing a user friendly experience.
           We specialise in events, bringing a competitive service to view. Our goal is to provide a ticket booking
           site where tickets can be bought close to face value, even if the event has sold out countrywide.

            Ran by a team of three second year college students, TC EVENTS is dedicated to ensuring its customers are
            100% satisfied with their experience. <br>The website was created in 2017, using HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap.

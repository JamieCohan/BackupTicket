        <p>
           We are TC EVENTS. We are a small company dedicated to providing a user friendly experience.
           We specialise in events, bringing a competitive service to view. Our goal is to provide a ticket booking
           site where tickets can be bought close to face value, even if the event has sold out countrywide.
